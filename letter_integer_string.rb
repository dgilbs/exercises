#Challenge is to take a string that varies between letters and numbers, consistently by the same number
#the string can be "1a2b", "12ab" and so on--it will always vary between letters and numbers, but will always have the same number
#goal is to take one of those strings and to return an array that creates sub strings of each set of numbers of letters
#i.e. result of "123abc456def" would be ["123", "abc", "456", "def"]
